Using the automake test Parallel Harness
1. Running tests
2. Adding a new test
3. Files in a test directory
4. Support for lltest, lldump, dbverify, llexec

1. Running tests
In the build area where the code was built, from either the 
top level build directory or preferably in the tests subdirectory, run
   make check 
running 'make clean' in the tests directory will remove the generated files
in the test subdirectories so that make check will re-run the tests.

To run a single test, say Royal92/Royal92 the test harness considers
a the file testname.log as the 'target' so remove it if it exists.
   rm Royal92/Royal92.log
   make Royal92/Royal92.log

If you want to debug the running of a test, the following command
will add lots of debug info in the test's directory testname.log file
   VERBOSE=1 make check
or
   VERBOSE=1 make clean check

If you are interested in debugging the gui with the detailed character
output from running a test with llines/llexec you can run the tests with
   CAPTUREOUT=1 make clean check

To check for memory errors when running a test, if you have valgrind
installed, do something like (say for the test Royal92/Royal92
   rm Royal92/Royal92.log
   TESTMEMCHECK=1  make Royal92/Royal92.log
But beware, that 2 second test run when run under valgrind will be more
like 20 seconds. The valgrind log would be in Royal92/Royal92-<pid>.valgrind.
Also, you can pass in valgrind options using the VALGRIND_OPTS environment
variable - but run_a_test envokes valgrind with the following options:
   valgrind --log-file=$testname-%p.valgrind --num-callers=16 --leak-check=yes 
You can use valgrind to do memory checks for all the tests if in the tests
directory you run the tests with the command
   TESTMEMCHECK=1  make clean check

The automake test structure is used to run the tests.
When done a file is created in the tests directory named test-suite.log.
It will summarize the results of running all the tests.  Passing tests
are just counted, failing tests include the contents of testname.log file.
testname.log files in the individual test sub directories, have more 
details about each part of the tests run, and which parts pass and fail.

2. Adding a new test:
The intent is to isolate testing from the users normal environment, so 
the .linesrc (or lines.src) file isn't read. Also building in the source
area or in a separate build area is supported, so there are a few things
that must be done - see below.

To add a test or group of similar tests, 
a. create a new subdirectory to put the test data
   (or add a test to an existing directory if it's related).
b. edit Makefile.am in this directory (the tests directory)
   a. add directory name to the testsubdir definition
   b. add the names of the llscr files (see below) to TESTS.
c. generate files described below. first a testname.llscr file to drive llines,
   a testname.ged if you need data for llines to manipulate, a testname.ll if
   you need to run a report (You probably do, as it's needed to generate a 
   .out file.)
d. and of course once you have the test running, copy the testname.out
   files to testname.out.ref to save the reference results, so the test
   can generate a PASS. (or to testname.32.out.ref and testname.64.out.ref
   if the files are different for 32 and 64 bit llines.  (Repeat for 
   any other reference files.)

3. Files in a test directory
The organization of the tests is a collection of directories that contain 
tests.  In each directory, there can be 1 or more tests. Each test consists
of the following:
   testname.ged           Optional. Some tests can be run without ged data.
   testname.ll            Required. A lifelines script that is to be run
   testname.llscr         Required. Commands to feed to llines 
                          If script runs any .ll files, the output should
                          be written to testname.out, as this is what is 
                          expected and is diff'ed with the reference output.
                          one catch. If the .llscr file loads a gedcom file
                          (testname.ged in the src area), say with a line
                          urmytest.ged
                          The testname (here mytest) must be replaced with
                          TESTNAME. The test environment replaces TESTNAME
                          with the name of the gedcom file, including path.
                          This way the gedcom file can be found when building
                          in separate build areas.  Thus that line would become
                          urTESTNAME.ged
   testname.out.ref       Required. Expected output from running testname.llscr.

if the expected output differs for 32 and 64 bit compiled programs, instead
of the testname.out.ref file, the following two are created
   testname.out.32.ref    Optional. Expected output for 32 bits.
   testname.out.32.ref    Optional. Expected output for 64 bits .
   lines.src              Optional. If the tests in a subdir needs to pass
                          environmental data to llines, if this file exists,
                          the tests will read this file.
   testname.config        Optional. File that contains test configuration data
      env NAME=Value      - set environment variables when running the test
      pre command args    - run command before running llines (not implemented)
      post command args   - run command after running llines
                            command is the name of a program to run. Typically
                            it is looked for in the tools or liflines directory
                            command is just the name, not a path and name
                            see Royal92 for examples
      skip                - Run test but exit with 77 telling test code
                            to skip this test.

In addition to the above mentioned testname.out, testname.out.ref file
which checks the output from running the .llscr script, there are other
files to capture output and reference files 
testname.command.out      Optional. stdout from running a post command.
testname.command.out.ref  Optional. reference file (in the source area)

The output of running llines is captured so that changes in the gui 
can be detected.
testname.llines.out       Generated. raw output from test 
testname.llines.out.filter  Generated. Filtered output from the test, which
                          tediously identifies each control sequence output
                          (assumes TERM is gnome or xterm)
testname.llines.out.filter.ref  Required. The reference filtered output.
                          note one of the strings llines outputs is
                          "Import time 01s (ui 00s)" with appropriate times
                          it is anonomized to "Import time xxs (ui xxs)"
testname-<pid>.valgrind   Generated - if test is run under valgrind.

If the testname.config file includes running some post commands, i.e.
a postcmd is named dbverify, lldump, lltest or llexec, then 
The following .out is generated and the corresponding .ref must be added to
the source test area.
testname.postcmd.out     Generated if needed for post commands
testname.postcmd.out.ref Required if needed for post commands



   The following files are generated by the test environment in the
   build area test sub directories when you do a 'make check' in the tests
   directory.
   testname.out           hopefully output from running the .ll script
                          which is diff'ed with the reference files to
                          determine success or failure.
   testname.log           log file with output from running the
                          run_a_test script (which runs the test and provides
                          the test environment with pass fail information
   testname.trs           test stats that the test environment uses
   testname.*diff          a diff of the output of the test, vs expected output
   testname.llscr.fix     this is the llsrc script that is fed to llines.
   testdb                 the name of the data base created for the test
   
each test is run, by doing essentially
   LLPROGRAMS=<path to source directory where this test resides>
    sed -e s@TESTNAME@<path to src area>/testname@ < testname.llscr \
        > testname.llscr.fix 
    llines -C <path_to_test_src_dir>/lines.src  testdb < testname.llscr.fix > testname.llines.out
The -C <path_to_test_src_dir>/lines.src prevents llines configuration files 
from creating non-standard environments.  Typically there is no lines.src
in the source directory for the test, so there is no .linesrc or lines.src 
file read. But if you need to say add some lang settings for a test,
you can create a lines.src file in the source of the test directory.
The testname.llines.out file is then filtered to remove run times and
program version information, and convert the terminal escape sequences
into a ascii description and written to testname.llines.out.filter

The TESTNAME magic is not needed for reading the testname.ll file, as
LLPROGRAMS is set to default the location where llines looks for .ll files
to the directory where the src of the tests is.
Do not use TESTNAME.log as this file should be written to the current
directory.

Sample testname.llscr file:
y
urTESTNAME
y
y
rtestname
testname.log
q
q

Just look at the existing tests for examples.


4. Support for lltest, lldump, dbverify, llexec
   See above, the testname.config files, post commands allow running
   programs in the src/tools and src/liflines directories, like

    post dbverify -a testdb
    post lldump -a testdb 
    post lltest testdb
    post llexec   -o testname.out -x TESTNAME.ll testdb

    with whatever options you need, assuming they are supported..
    llexec is a bit more tricky, as you probably want it to
    read the testname.ll file for this test, and put the output to testname.out
